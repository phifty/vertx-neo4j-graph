# TODOs

* API: Check whether vert.x 3 extension support can be utilized to simplify neo4vertx integration.
  Currently a dedicated verticle has to be started.

* Maven: It should be possible to do a site deployment during maven release. 
  Site building should be disabled for all modules except the doc project.
