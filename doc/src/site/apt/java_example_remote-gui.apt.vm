Java GUI/Remote Example

  The {{{${gh-url}/examples/java/src/main/java/org/openpcf/neo4vertx/examples/GUIDemoVerticle.java}GUIDemoVerticle}} and {{{${gh-url}/examples/java/src/main/java/org/openpcf/neo4vertx/examples/RemoteDemoVerticle.java}RemoteDemoVerticle}} can be used together to demonstrate the remote api capability.
  
  It is possible to use neo4vertx together with an external neo4j database. In this case a <<<restUrl>>> parameter has to be specified. Neo4Vertx will not startup any neo4j embedded database when run in remote mode. 
  It is also not possible to use the advanced features when in this mode. The gui mode on the other hand will startup an embedded neo4j database and in addition a jetty server which provides a neo4j rest api on port 7474. 

  It is best to startup the GUIDemoVerticle first since it will startup a neo4j with a rest api backend on port 7474. 
  The remote example verticle can be started afterwards. The remote example will than execute queries using a simple embedded rest client.
