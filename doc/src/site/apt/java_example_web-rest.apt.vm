Java Vert.x Web REST Example

  This example covers the steps that are needed to get started with vert.x 3 and create a RESTful service which is backed by Neo4j.
  
  Components which are used:

  * Vert.x 3 - Application platform

  * Vert.x Web - Swiss Army Knife for building modern, scalable, web apps similar to Yoke or expressjs.

  * Neo4vertx - Extension that enables neo4j access


Setup

  Create a new maven project and add the listed dependencies. Make sure to set you compiler plugin to 1.8 as shown below. Vert.x 3 requires Java 8.  

%{include|source=doc/target/examples/neo4vertx-examples/java-web-rest/pom.xml}

  The example consists of just two classes.
  The {{{${gh-url}/examples/java-web-rest/src/main/java/org/openpcf/neo4vertx/example/Runner.java}Runner}} is responsible for verticle deployment and setup of neo4vertx. 

%{include|source=doc/target/examples/neo4vertx-examples/java-web-rest/src/main/java/org/openpcf/neo4vertx/example/Runner.java}

  The {{{${gh-url}/examples/java-web-rest/src/main/java/org/openpcf/neo4vertx/example/DemoVerticle.java}DemoVerticle}} will start the http server and setup the REST endpoints.

%{include|source=doc/target/examples/neo4vertx-examples/java-web-rest/src/main/java/org/openpcf/neo4vertx/example/DemoVerticle.java}

  The start() method contains the code that is responsible for the setup of the http server and the routing of the various REST endpoints.
  Please note that you can start the vertx HttpServer in any verticle you deploy. The httpserver is shared across your verticles.
  The router functionality is part of the vertx-web project. Routers and routes allows the convenient creation REST endpoint handlers.

%{include|source=doc/target/examples/neo4vertx-examples/java-web-rest/src/main/java/org/openpcf/neo4vertx/example/DemoVerticle.java|snippet=#start}

  Once the <<<Runner>>> class has been executed various urls can be accessed in order to interact with the DemoVerticle.

Service URLs

  * {{http://localhost:8080/api/v1/demo/clear}}

  * {{http://localhost:8080/api/v1/demo/addFlower}}

  * {{http://localhost:8080/api/v1/demo/insert}}

  * {{http://localhost:8080/api/v1/demo/count}}

  * {{http://localhost:7474/browser}}
